# Engineering Science Building

[Repository source](https://git.isis.vanderbilt.edu/SmartBuildings/EngineeringScienceBuilding)

[GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/hazrmard/EngineeringScienceBuilding)


These files document research on smart control of HVAC systems using data-driven methods.

The purpose of this project is to analyze performance of HVAC systems - particularly chillers and cooling towers - in the Engineering Science Building (ESB) at Vanderbilt University to develop control approaches to maximize cooling and power efficiency.

The documentation is divided into a discussion of background concepts in physics, jargon in the HVAC industry, layout of air conditioning systems, and a description of the dataset specific to the system at ESB.
