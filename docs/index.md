These files document basics of HVAC systems and smart control approaches as they pertain to the scope of this research.

The purpose of this project is to analyze performance of HVAC systems - particularly chillers and cooling towers - in the Engineering Science Building (ESB) at Vanderbilt University to develop control approaches to maximize cooling and power efficiency.

The documentation is divided into a discussion of background concepts in physics, jargon in the HVAC industry, layout of air conditioning systems, and a description of the dataset specific to the system at ESB.
