# Documentation

These files document basics of HVAC systems as they pertain to the scope of this research.

The purpose of this project is to analyze performance of HVAC systems - particularly chillers and cooling towers - in the Engineering Science Building (ESB) at Vanderbilt University.

The documentation is divided into a discussion of background concepts in physics, jargon in the HVAC industry, layout of air conditioning systems, and a description of the dataset specific to the system at ESB.
